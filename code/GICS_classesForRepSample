We decided to try to identify a group of stocks that would give us a good representative sample of stocks and the overall state of the market. 

After some research we learned of GICS Stock Market Sectors. They are global industry classification standards for all listed companies on the market. All stocks are put into sectors by GICS or its rival stock classfier the ICB. For our purposes the differences between the classification systems isn't super relevent because we only really care about creating an accurate picture of the market through a sample of all stock 'sectors'. Overall, both the ICB and GICS can inform our choices and their general sector classs are similar even though they both take a different approach to classifying stocks.

At the end of the day we have decided to choose our stocks to be representative of the market
