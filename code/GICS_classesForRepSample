We decided to try to identify a group of stocks that would give us a good representative sample of stocks and the overall state of the market. 

After some research, we learned of GICS Stock Market Sectors, which represent global industry classification standards for all listed companies on the market. All stocks are put into sectors by GICS or its rival stock classfier the Industrial Classification Benchmark (ICB). For our purposes, the differences between the classification systems aren't very relevant because we only really care about creating an accurate picture of the market through a sample of all stock sectors. Overall, both the ICB and GICS can inform our choices and their general sector classes are similar even though they both take a different approach to classifying stocks.

At the end of the day, we decided to choose stocks that best represent the current market as a whole using the GICS classification because it has been more long-standing in the market as opposed to ICB (1999 vs 2004). 

"The GICS classification system consists of four levels. As of 2022, there are 11 sectors, 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries."

We chose to use data from one or two stocks from each of the 11 GICS sectors to try and provide a large-scale picture of how the market reacts to changes in certain indicators. For Sectors in which we believed there was more than one stock needed to give a representative picture (for example, Industrials) we have selected two stocks. In industrials, we have chosen UPS and Raytheon. We chose Raytheon because it represents the defense and engineering side of this sector and UPS because it shows the transportation side of the sector. In other cases, like with Microsoft and Google, we chose both of their stocks because neither of the two stocks is more representative than the other in our current market. For consumer industries, we decided to choose Amazon and McDonaldâ€™s because they represent different parts of the wide range of the consumer industry. By selecting two stocks in industries where we see fit, we ensure that we represent the majority of a sector but also keep our views broad enough.
